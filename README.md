Fun 2 player game with the dice in the center :)

# Rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on a GLOBAL score wins the game!
