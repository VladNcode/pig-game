    <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
    </p>
    <p>- In each turn, a player rolls dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.</p>
    <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
    <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that,
      it's
      the next player's turn.</p>
    <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on a GLOBAL score wins the game!</p>
